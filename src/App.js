//STEPS FOR THIS. 
//need to create a recducer folder which is going to hold ym reducer fuctions for the add/remove features
//need to create a action folder which will hold the actions for the add/remove 
//should write the reducers first and then go and work on the actions and figure out where to impliment them
//import <Provider> into index.js
//have to create a store(not to sure where tho)
//have to connect things together 
//implement mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps, will also have to implement props in neccessary areas
